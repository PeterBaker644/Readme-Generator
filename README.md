This command line based readme generator prompts the user for information using the command line and assembles a markdown file given the github information and user response. It's important to note that a repository must be made ahead of time so the generator can read user and project information. It includes imporant sections such as a dynamically created table of content, installation instructions, readme badges, and dynamic licensing.
